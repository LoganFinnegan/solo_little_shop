## Welcome to our Little Esty Shop. 
In this application we created a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants can access and view their inventory and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. We have features that include adding, editing, enabling, and disabling items from a certain merchant. You can view the top items for each merchant as well as the top selling date for those top items. You can also create and add a new merchants with admin status. You are also able to disable and enable merchants as an admin.

### Some ideas for potential future contributors:
- One additional feature would be to add an items index or a merchantâ€™s index so users can view all items or merchants that are available on the site. 
- Another useful feature addition could be to add more statistical information on items and merchants to help merchants make inventory decisions. For example, top selling items for the site, or most popular merchants.
